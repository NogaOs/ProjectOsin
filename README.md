# ZoukCalendar (WIP)

ZoukCalendar was originally planned to help the Israeli [Brazilian Zouk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HD7uWRaEGvY "Brazilian Zouk Dance Video") dance community to schedule parties and assign teachers and DJs. Unfortunately, when the covid-19 pandemic hit, the platform was no longer needed, and the project came to a halt. It is at a standstill until today.


### So Why is it Public?
Because there are some pretty cool stuff here, like a neat login system (using salt and bcrypt), a Flask app server, and a PostreSQL server that runs on AWS.
If you wanna check those stuff out, here's where:

Login  | database/funcs.py
------------- | -------------
Datbaste  | database/db_def.py
Flask  | server/app_server.py
